Homework 01 - Game of life.

Your task is to implement a kind of cellular automaton called "Game of life".
The automaton is a 2D simulation where each cell on the grid is either dead
or alive.

The state of each cell is updated in every iteration based state of neighbouring cells.
Cell neighbours are cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

Rules for the update are as follows:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


Our implementation uses the coordinate system with grid coordinates starting
from (0, 0) - upper left corner. The first coordinate is a row, and the second
is a column.

Do not use wrap-around (toroid) when reaching the edge of the board.
